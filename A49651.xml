            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The LAST SPEECHES AND CONFESSIONS OF Captain <hi>Thomas Walcott, John Rowſe,</hi> and <hi>William Hone,</hi> Joyner, At the Common Place of EXECUTION <hi>On</hi> Friday <hi>the</hi> 20th. <hi>of this preſent</hi> July, 1683. Who were all found Guilty of High-Treaſon, For Conſpiring the <hi>Death</hi> of His Moſt Sacred Majeſty, And his Royal Brother James Duke of York.</head>
            <p>THe many and continual Judgements which are inflicted upon reſolute Offenders, but eſpecially ſuch as ſtudy &amp; contrive the ſhedding of innocent blood, methinks might be ſufficient to detect and hinder others from their wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked progreſſes; but ſuch is the ſtubbornneſs of this Age, that they are rather hardned than mollified by the threatning dangers of a diſpleaſed Deity. How many Horrid and Damnable Plots have been Conſpired againſt His moſt Gracious Majeſty; which by mercy and Providence of the Almighty have all proved ineffectual, and proclaimed the impudence of the Authors to be unparalleld;

ſo, you may ſee by this Horrid Conſpiracy, lately detected by the goodneſs of God Almighty, how, when they thought themſelves a good as certain of their carrying on their deſign anſwerable to their own mind, and bloody diſpoſitions, that then their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues were laid open, their Treaſons diſcovered, and their own lives brought into a ſhare, as you may read in theſe following Lines.</p>
            <p>At the Seſſions of Oyer and Terminer, that began at the <hi>Old Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> on <hi>Thurſday Iuly</hi> 12. 1683. And when the Court was ſate, Captain <hi>Thomas VValcott</hi> appeared at the Bar, his Indictment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read he pleaded not guilty; but Coll. <hi>Rumſey</hi> teſtified upon Oath that there had been divers Conſultations about killing the King as He wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to return from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and that it was deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be acted near the dwelling Houſe of one <hi>Rumbold</hi> a Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, not far from <hi>Hodſoon</hi> in <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> and that <hi>VValcott</hi> was in nomination to be the perſon that ſhould perpetrate this Villany, but he refuſed to do that, and choſe rather to ingage the Lifeguard which was attending His Majeſty, that they being cut off, they might the more readily carry on their purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Collonel Rumſey</hi> declared that there was ſeveral Conſultations hold about this Diabolical contrivance, which the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Pemberton</hi> by diligent enquiry into, found to be at ſeveral p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gate,</hi> and about <hi>Mile end Green;</hi> to which <hi>VValcott</hi> pleaded, that at that time theſe Conſultations were held, he was Lame of the <hi>Gout,</hi> and witneſs offered to juſtify the ſame, made anſwer, that he was certainly ſick of the Gour ſome conſiderable time, but whether it was juſt at that time or not he could not poſſitively ſwear.</p>
            <p>Then Captain <hi>VValcott</hi> reply'd that it was very hard that four men ſhould combine againſt his Life, and impeaching him ſave their own.</p>
            <p>But Mr. Attourney General opened the Caſe, laying open the danger of concealing Treaſon, to which he anſwered that he was meerly drawn in to the concern, and alſo that he thought concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Treaſon was but miſpriſion of Treaſon, but my Lord an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that to be in Conſultation and not to diſcover was real Treaſon.</p>
            <p>So the Jury having taken notice of what he Confeſſed, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately brought in their Verdict, that he was Guilty of High Treaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VVill. Hone</hi> having been Examined on <hi>Thurſday</hi> was again brought to the Bar on Friday morning, and then deſired the Plea he made yeſterday might be allowed, which was, that he was Guilty of a Conſpiracy, but not concern'd in raiſing of Arms to cauſe a Rebellion, but the Indictment imported, that as a falſe Traytor he had Conſpired to Depoſe the King of His Crown and Dignity, and particularly at a Conſult on the ſecond of <hi>March,</hi> in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Michael Biſhaw,</hi> where <hi>Rumbold, Furguſon, Holliway Roe, Francis</hi> and <hi>Richard Goodenough,</hi> and many o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The next that came to the Bar was Mr. <hi>Rouſe,</hi> who had ſeveral Witneſſes ſworn againſt him, and accuſed him of the ſame manner of Crimes as was ſworn againſt <hi>Hone;</hi> He could make but little defence for himſelf; it being abſolutely ſworn againſt him, That he had a Hand in the Conſpiracy againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Life: But, notwithſtanding all his ſlender evaſions, the Court ſoon brought him in Guilty of HIGH-TREASON; And he was charged with ſeveral Treaſonable Deſignes, as, not only to deſtroy the King's Majeſty, but alſo to Levy War, and by ſtirring the people up to Sedition, thereby to raiſe a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and Subvert the Government; All which the Witneſſes for the King poſitively Swore; and he being not able to diſprove, the Sentence was paſt againſt him, and the other two, in manner following:
